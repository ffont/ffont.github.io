I'm a post-doctoral researcher and software developer at the [Music Technology Group](http://www.mtg.upf.edu) of [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu), Barcelona. I like everything that has to do with sound and music, software development, audio processing, synthesizers, and the like.

At the Music Technology Group I lead the [Freesound](https://freesound.org) project and all Freesound-related stuff. Freesound is a website where people from all over the world share sounds under Creative Commons licenses. As of September 2019, Freesound hosts more than 420k sounds and has more than 9M registered users. 

From 2016-2019, I was also the coordinator of the EU H2020-funded project [Audio Commons](https://www.audiocommons.org), aimed at the promotion of Creative Commons audio and the development of technological solutions to facilitate audio description, indexing, reuse and publication.

My research is focused on understanding how to analyze and describe large sound collections so that these become more useful in creative contexts. I'm interested in audio processing, audio metadata and machine learning for the semantic annotation of sound collections. I'm also interested in exploratory interfaces and new tools for making music from such large collections.

Besides the research, I like working on other *just for fun* creative projects, typically with something to do with music technology and software development. I also play the bass guitar in a couple of bands and make noise with my synthetisers.
